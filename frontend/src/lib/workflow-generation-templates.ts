      "Sequential implementation with distinct research, build, and test phases",
    content: `Create a multi-stage workflow that breaks this task into sequential phases, each with its own verification.

## Task Description
[DESCRIBE_THE_TASK — what needs to be accomplished end-to-end]

## Phases (adjust as needed)
1. **Research / Analysis**
   - [What to investigate or discover before starting implementation]
   - Verification: [How to confirm research is complete — e.g., output file exists, key findings documented]

2. **Implementation**
   - [What to build, modify, or configure]
   - Verification: [How to confirm implementation works — e.g., tests pass, build succeeds, endpoint responds]

3. **Testing / Validation**
   - [What to test beyond basic implementation checks]
   - Verification: [How to confirm quality — e.g., integration tests, UI checks, performance benchmarks]

## Instructions
1. Create a multi-stage workflow using the \`stages\` array
2. Each phase becomes a stage with its own setup, verification, agentic, and completion steps
3. Assess difficulty per stage and set provider/model accordingly:
   - Simple stages (checks, file ops): use faster model
   - Complex stages (implementation, debugging): use capable model
4. Every stage MUST have deterministic verification steps
5. Later stages can reference output from earlier stages
6. Set \`stop_on_failure: false\` unless sequential correctness is critical`,

      "Post-deployment verification: check critical user flows still work",
    content: `Generate a workflow that verifies critical user flows work correctly after a deployment.

## Application
- URL: [APP_URL, e.g. https://staging.myapp.com]
- Environment: [ENV, e.g. staging, production]

## Critical Flows to Verify
1. **Authentication**
   - Login with valid credentials → lands on dashboard
   - Invalid credentials → shows error message
   - Logout → redirects to login page

2. **Navigation**
   - All main nav links load without errors
   - Breadcrumbs and back navigation work
   - [Add specific routes critical to your app]

3. **Key Forms**
   - [FORM_1, e.g. User profile update — fill fields, submit, verify saved]
   - [FORM_2, e.g. Search — enter query, verify results appear]

4. **Data Display**
   - [PAGE_1, e.g. Dashboard — verify charts/widgets load with data]
   - [PAGE_2, e.g. List views — verify items render, pagination works]

## Instructions
1. Connect to the deployed application via UI Bridge or Playwright
2. Execute each critical flow in sequence
3. For each step, verify the expected outcome (page loads, elements present, data displayed)
4. If a flow fails, capture a screenshot and error details
5. Create verification steps for each flow checkpoint

      "Evaluate UX and visual polish using UI Bridge quality metrics + AI analysis",
    content: `Evaluate a page's design quality in two phases: UX first, then visual polish.

## Application
- URL: [APP_URL, e.g. http://localhost:3001]
- Page: [PAGE_PATH, e.g. /admin, /dashboard]

## Phase 1: UX Evaluation (Do This First)
Run the quality evaluator and focus on UX metrics:
1. Connect to the app via UI Bridge
2. Navigate to the target page
3. Run sdk_design_evaluate with context "general"
4. Review UX-category metrics: contentOverflow, aboveFoldRatio, informationDensity, containerEfficiency, viewportUtilization
5. For each UX issue found, create a verification step that checks the specific metric

Ask yourself:
- Can the user see the most important content without scrolling?
- Is screen space used efficiently, or are containers oversized for their data?
- Is content reachable? What percentage is below the fold?
- Does the layout use the full viewport, or waste large regions?

## Phase 2: Visual Polish (After UX Is Addressed)
Only focus on polish after UX metrics score well (>70):
1. Re-run sdk_design_evaluate
2. Review polish metrics: spacing, color, typography, consistency
3. Also review qualitatively — things metrics can't catch:
   - Does the visual hierarchy match importance hierarchy?
   - Are related items grouped logically?
   - Is the page scannable? Can you find key info in 3 seconds?
   - Are interactive elements clearly distinguishable from static content?
   - Is there a clear primary action on the page?

## Critical Constraint: Preserve All Information
When implementing style or layout refactors, ALL information and functionality from the original page MUST be retained. A UX improvement means better presentation of the same data — never removal of content. If the original page shows 8 tabs, 6 metrics, or a table with 7 columns, the redesigned version must include all of them. Reformat, reorganize, and restyle freely, but do not drop features, sections, or data fields.

## Phase 3: Recommendations
For each finding, generate an agentic prompt step that:
- Describes the specific issue with element IDs
- Explains why it hurts usability or polish
- Suggests a concrete fix within the existing design system
- Ensures all original information and features are preserved in the fix`,

    content: `Instrument an existing React project with the UI Bridge SDK so it can be discovered, inspected, and verified by Qontinui workflows.

## Project
- Path: [PROJECT_PATH, e.g. C:\\Users\\me\\my-react-app]
- Framework: [FRAMEWORK, e.g. Next.js 15, Vite + React, Create React App]
- App URL when running: [APP_URL, e.g. http://localhost:3000]

## What to Instrument
- [List key pages/routes, e.g. /dashboard, /settings, /users, or "all routes"]
- [List key interactive elements, e.g. forms, modals, navigation, or "discover automatically"]

## Instructions
1. Install the UI Bridge SDK package: \`npm install @anthropic/ui-bridge\` (or check if already installed)
2. Wrap the root layout with \`<UIBridgeProvider>\` — find the top-level layout file and add the provider
3. For each page/route listed above:
   a. Add \`data-ui-id\` attributes to all interactive and semantically meaningful elements following the naming convention: \`{feature}-{component}-{element}\` with suffixes like \`-btn\`, \`-input\`, \`-link\`
   b. Register key interactive elements (buttons, inputs, links, toggles) with the \`useUIElement\` hook
   c. Register component-level actions with \`useUIComponent\` for forms and complex components
   d. Register important UI states (loading, error, empty) with \`useUIState\`
   e. Create a \`.spec.uibridge.json\` file alongside the page with grouped assertions:
      - An \`element-presence\` group verifying core layout elements exist
      - A \`state-consistency\` group verifying interactive element states (enabled/disabled, initial values)
      - A \`semantic\` group describing the page's purpose and key capabilities
      - Use diverse assertion types: exists, enabled, disabled, hasText, containsText, hasValue — not just exists
      - Use conditions for state-dependent assertions
      - Use graduated severity: critical for core, warning for important, info for nice-to-have
4. Verify the instrumented app starts without errors and the UI Bridge endpoints respond
5. Connect via UI Bridge and confirm elements are discoverable

## Spec File Format
Each spec file should follow this structure:
\`\`\`json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Specs for [page name]",
  "groups": [
    { "id": "...", "name": "...", "category": "element-presence", "assertions": [...], "source": "manual" },
