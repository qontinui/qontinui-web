"""The D3 allowlist for a public build record, and the validator that enforces it.

Plan ``2026-10-09-factory-built-product-portfolio-and-launch-kit``, design
decision D3 ("public redaction is explicit, not implied") and Phase 1.

coord's ``coord_build_record`` composer applies this allowlist at its one exit.
qontinui-web applies it AGAIN before a document is frozen into
``web.build_record_snapshots``, and once more every time the public route
serves one — defence in depth, so a coord regression cannot reach the
unauthenticated reader. The key set is the binding cross-repo contract's
``build-record/1`` schema, key for key; ``tests/test_build_records.py`` pins it.

What the validator refuses
==========================

**Size**, before anything else: a document over 1 MiB serialized, and any
scanned string over 512 characters (both reported by slot). Every regex below
is written to run in linear time (anchored starts, possessive quantifiers),
so with the caps no input can make validation slow — the public route runs it
on every read.

**Shape.** Any key not in :data:`BUILD_RECORD_ALLOWLIST`, at any depth; a
container where a scalar belongs and the reverse.

**Per-slot value types.** Every leaf has a declared kind (:class:`Slot`):

* counts and the PR number — ``int`` or ``null`` (``bool`` refused, since it
  is an ``int`` subclass in Python);
* timestamps — an RFC 3339 string, or ``null`` where the contract allows it;
* statuses — coord's canonical work-unit vocabulary
  (:data:`WORK_UNIT_STATUSES`, ``WorkUnitStatus::from_wire`` in qontinui-coord
  ``work_unit_registry.rs``); a legacy opaque status is refused, never passed;
* repos — ``owner/name``; the product slug — the product slug pattern;
  work-unit slugs — :data:`WORK_UNIT_SLUG_RE` (plan stems are longer);
* PR and work-unit titles — any string or ``null`` (coord nulls a title that
  would fail the scan below and records ``<path>: not_established``);
* timestamps are PARSED, not only pattern-matched;
* ``unknowns[]`` and ``sessions.unknown_reason`` — ONLY the constrained form
  ``<allowlisted path>: <reason code>`` with a reason from
  :data:`UNKNOWN_REASON_CODES`. Free text is refused: it is the one slot an
  unvetted sentence (a device name, an operator, a findings body) would ride.

**Content, in every string anywhere** (titles included), read after NFKC
normalisation with lookalike slashes mapped to ``/`` and spaces around ``/``
removed (:func:`normalize_for_scan`):

* an ``owner/name`` token that is not one of ``product.repos`` — a private
  repo name leaking through a title, a slug or an unknown;
* a UUID-shaped substring, dashed or as a bare 32-hex run (device,
  session, user and tenant ids);
* an email-shaped substring, ``user@host`` included (operator identities).

Two layers against characters that hide a token. (1) A string carrying a
format, control, unassigned, private-use or surrogate character, any
``Default_Ignorable_Code_Point``, or a combining overlay (U+0334–U+0338,
U+20D2/3, U+20E5/6) is refused outright. (2) Every check runs on a STRIPPED
form anyway (:func:`normalize_for_scan`: NFKD, drop marks and invisibles,
NFKC, lookalike and infix-symbol slashes), so a character outside the refusal
set still cannot split a token. Neither layer is claimed complete; together
they close every probe in ``tests/test_build_records.py``.

:func:`names_token` is the token-bounded check the publish route also runs
for the NAMES of repos coord excluded (defined but not in the document) —
on every scanned slot except :data:`EXCLUDED_NAME_EXEMPT_PATHS`.

**Cross-field.** A ``schema`` other than :data:`BUILD_RECORD_SCHEMA`; a PR
whose ``repo`` is not one of ``product.repos`` (coord lists only repos
POSITIVELY known public there).

A key the allowlist names but the document omits is not a violation: absence
leaks nothing. Violation messages name the SLOT, never the offending value
(an unlisted key is reported as ``<unlisted key>``), so a refusal cannot
itself leak what it refused.

Known false-positive class, accepted fail-closed: a title containing a
non-repo ``a/b`` token (``CI/CD``) is refused. Two all-digit segments
(``2026/10``) are exempt.
